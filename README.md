# Architecture

Uses domain driven design. It's a bit overkill for this project, but I'd rather start by building something robust from the beginning instead of refactoring a bunch later.

# side note

Flavors missing for iOS because I do not have macOS. While I could manually edit macOS files, it's not something that I'm comfortable doing without testing on a iOS emulator to validate that flavors work.
